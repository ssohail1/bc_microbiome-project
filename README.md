## Project - Analysis of Breast Cancer Microbial Datasets
#### Background
The microbiome is a collection of bacteria that reside in tissues where in cancer it has been implicated in a variety of tissues, and specifically distinct microbial communities have been linked to different types of cancers [[Hieken et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4971513/)]. The association of microbial communities to human health has prompted researchers to investigate the microbial ecology of various tissues leading to a surplus of microbial data. This in turn has led to the development of various software and tools that can analyze microbial data and disentangle the biological variation from amplicon sequencing errors [[Callahan et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927377/)]. Here, I analyze data from _The Microbiome of Aseptically Collected Human Breast Tissue in Benign and Malignant Disease_ study by [Hieken et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4971513/) using DADA2 [[Callahan et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927377/)], where the dataset can be downloaded from the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) using this accession number PRJNA335375.
